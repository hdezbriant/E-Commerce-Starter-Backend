## Getting Started

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database using the MySQL shell command: 

```mysql -u **YOUR USERNAME** -p < db/schema.sql```

After completing the prompt by entering your password, a database called `ecommerce_db` will be created!

To seed the newly created database with placeholder data: using your terminal, run the command: 

```npm run seed```

After this step, you're all set!
